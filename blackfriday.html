                <h3>Commonwealth Counseling <br> Associates, PC</h3>
                <h4>Dr J. Bullock</h4>
                <p>"Our rapidly growing healthcare business urgently required a broadly experienced bookkeeper to assist
                    with complex payroll issues and related tax and bookkeeping duties. Mrs. Arnold quickly learned our
                    business protocols and work flow; as a result, she was able to take over many of the core
                    bookkeeping
                    tasks, including the more complex tasks, immediately. This is particularly impressive because the
                    consulting relationship we established relies largely on electronic communication, as our firm is
                    located
                    about 100 miles south of Mrs. Arnold's offices. I have found Mrs. Arnold to be very bright, very
                    knowledgeable, detail-oriented, precise in her work, and proactive in addressing our needs.
                    Moreover, she
                    has been prompt and personable in all of our dealings with her."</p>

                <p>"We contracted with Legible Ledgers after our previous accountants were fired and Marjorie was
                    brought on
                    to clean up our accounting books and records. It was in a bad shape but Marjorie was able to get the
                    books
                    reconciled in a timely manner. We knew we had someone good when our client invoices went on time
                    without
                    any issues. She is great with her knowledge of QuickBooks and made our lives much easier!"</p>

                    professional, timely, and trustworthy. Besides just being capable, she gave us the attention we
                    needed as

                <h4>A. Doman</h4>
                <p>"Ms. Marjorie Arnold provided exemplary service to my organization. She entered and reconciled 19
                    months
                    of raw data into QB to get our organization up and running in record time after months of not using
                    QB.
                    She was able to grasp our former Treasurer's system and make recommendation and changes to improve
                    our QB
                    usage. This included, Ms. Arnold developing reports to make it easier for us to query and generate
                    data.
                    She is very personable, approachable and makes you feel comfortable when asking questions. I am
                    extremely
                    appreciative of the services she provided and just wish my organization had met her sooner. Thank
                    you
